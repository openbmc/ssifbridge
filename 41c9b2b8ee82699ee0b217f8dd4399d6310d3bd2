I\u0027d be really surprised if this mattered now.\n\nIn theory this just gets initialized to null, so I\u0027m not really sure how it could have any effect as written.  Maybe Chuong knows?",

      "message": "@EdTanous, yes, this is the workaround which mentioned below in main() since at the time I added that code, I did not have any better solution. The timer `rspTimer` just makes sure that there is a response to host within `hostReqTimeout`; therefore any timer type will work.\n\nDid you test this patch on your system? If it works, I am ok with this patch.\n\nBy the way, you are using this ssifbridge in your system? which ssif driver you are using?",
